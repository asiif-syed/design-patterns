# What is it?
- The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. 
- The adapter acts as a bridge, converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.
## Key Concepts of Adapter Pattern:
- Target Interface: This is the interface that the client expects to use.
- Adaptee: The existing interface that needs to be adapted.
- Adapter: A class that implements the Target Interface and makes the Adaptee’s interface compatible with the Target Interface.
- Client: The entity that interacts with the Adapter through the Target Interface.
## When to Use the Adapter Pattern:
- When you want to use a class that doesn’t have the required interface.
- When you need to integrate with a legacy system that uses different interfaces.
- When you want to reuse existing code but it doesn’t match the new system’s interface.
## Benefits:
- Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Promotes code reusability.
- Decouples the client from concrete implementations of the adaptee.
## Real-World Use Cases:
### Integrating Legacy Systems: 
- Often, companies need to integrate new systems with legacy systems that have incompatible interfaces. An adapter can be used to bridge the two systems by converting requests and responses between them.
- Example: An old payment gateway system uses XML, and a new client system expects JSON. An adapter can convert between the XML and JSON formats, allowing the systems to work together.
### Third-Party Library Integration: 
- When you want to integrate third-party libraries or APIs that don’t match your system’s interface, an adapter can help smooth the interaction without modifying the existing code.
- Example: A graphics rendering library might have a different method signature from what your system uses. You could create an adapter to match the expected interface of your rendering engine.
### Adapter for Different Protocols: 
- In network communication, various protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP) may need to interact. An adapter can convert between different protocols, allowing seamless communication.
- Example: A system may need to send files using both HTTP and FTP protocols. An adapter could help abstract the differences between these protocols and provide a unified interface for sending files. 
### Driver Adapter: 
- Hardware manufacturers often use adapters in device drivers to make hardware (like printers or cameras) compatible with various operating systems without changing the underlying hardware interface.
- Example: A printer driver can act as an adapter between the operating system’s printing API and the printer’s proprietary communication protocol.
