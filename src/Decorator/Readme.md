# What is it?
- The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 
- This is accomplished by "wrapping" the original object with a decorator object that adds new functionality while preserving the original object's interface.

## Key Features of the Decorator Pattern:
- Enhances functionality: It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- Maintains the object's core behavior: The original object remains unchanged, and the decorator adds new behavior without altering the object's structure.
- Composition over inheritance: It allows you to combine multiple decorators to add various functionalities dynamically.
