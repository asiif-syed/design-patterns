# What is it?
- The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
- This pattern is useful when you need to create objects that are part of a family (or related objects) but don't want the client code to know about the specific classes being used.

## Example
- Imagine you are setting up a UI toolkit for different platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. You want to create platform-specific UI components (like buttons, checkboxes, etc.). Instead of writing platform-specific code everywhere, you use an Abstract Factory:
- A WindowsFactory creates WindowsButton and WindowsCheckbox. 
- A MacFactory creates MacButton and MacCheckbox. 
- The client code only interacts with the factory, without needing to know which platform it's working on.
